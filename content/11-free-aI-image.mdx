Update Mei 29, 2025: This list is now maintained here:

[stable diffusion art](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/free-ai-image-generator-sites/)

Cost of generating AI images has plummeted since the release of Stable Diffusion. There are free sites coming up and shutting down literally every week. Here I am putting together a ranked list of free sites and intend to keep it updated periodically.

This list is ranked by usability.

[**Mage Space**](https://www.mage.space/)

Mage Space has a very simple interface. The nice thing about this site is it does not require sign up — You can generate images right away! However, the rendering option is limited.

[**Playground AI**](https://playground.com/)

Playground AI combines image creation and social network. You can create, share and like images, and follow creators. The rendering option is limited but speed is pretty good.

[**Lexica**](https://lexica.art)

Lexica is a popular AI image search site. Now supports image generation. Just press Generate instead of Search! Sign-in required.

[**Neural.love**](https://neural.love/ai-art-generator)

Free image generation after sign-up. Appeared to process prompt before feeding into model. Allegedly using the latest Stable Diffusion 1.5. Limited setting.

[**You.com AI image generator**](https://you.com/search?q=stable+diffusion)

Free Stable Diffusion image generator. No additional options.

[**Stable Horde**](https://aqualxx.github.io/stable-ui/)

Stable Horde generate images by user donated processing power, aka crowd sourced computing. It does not require sign. It’s relatively powerful, supporting negative prompts. The downside is the rending is pretty slow.

[**Craiyon**](https://www.craiyon.com/)

DALL-E mini model. Completely free and requires no sign-up. Rendering is a bit slow.

[**AI art maker by hotpot.ai**](https://hotpot.ai/art-generator)

After signing up, allow you to create images for free with their own model. The image is a bit small and option is limited.

[**Dream Studio**](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/generate)

From the creator of Stable Diffusion, Stability AI. It’s not technically free but you get a few free credits when you sign up. I expect the will be the first to get the latest and greatest up and running.

[**Night Cafe**](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/)

Not technically free but you will get a few free credits after you sign up.

That’s it for now! Will add more.
